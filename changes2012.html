			<H1>Changes in 2012</H1><P>
In December 2011 the Auckland LUG suffered from a server failure on the part of <A HREF=http://www.linux.net.nz>Linux.net.nz</A> - who had been hosting AuckLUG's mailing list since it first established, and also hosted information about AuckLUG Events. Auckland LUG discussions moved to a temporarily-reformed-NZLUG Mailing list (hosted by the NZOSS) for several months.  At the meeting of the Auckalnd LUG held on 2 April 2012 a whole raft of the issues facing Auckland LUG (in terms of where-to-from-here) were tabled for discussion.  In the aftermath of this meeting a few changes were made.
<P>
<UL><LI>Auckland LUG Mailing List was moved to <A HREF=https://groups.google.com/group/aucklug>Google Groups</A>.  This was in a desire to move the LUG core over to a 'cloud' environment that didn't become dependent on a single person and allowed for multiple folks to manage it over time. Several other options were tabled and (for the moment) discarded.
<LI>The Mailing List Membership Database was rebuilt by Mark Foster and Nic Bellamy based on the last recoverable backup of linux.net.nz, plus all sub/unsub events logged subsequent. So it should be pretty complete.  Glen ported this complete list to Google Groups.
<LI>Meetings.  Status quo for many years has been that the LUG meets on the 'First Monday of the Month'.  Several members can't regularly make meetings on Monday nights for various reasons, so it was opted to move meetings to 'The First Working Day of the Month'. This will be a Monday on average 3 meetings out of 7, but allow folks who cannot make Monday meetings to attend at least some of our meetings.
<LI>Meetings will happen monthly and <B>will</B> include December and January (these have often been skipped due to the holiday season).  However these may be more social type meetings, with dinner etc.
<LI>Food.  The Venue will try to organise Tea & Coffee for meetings.
<LI>RSVP.  An optional RSVP for meetings would be helpful for the venue (for capacity planning) and is to be investigated.</UL><P>

The summary as posted to the LUG by Glen Ogilvie in the aftermath of the meeting can be viewed in the <A HREF=https://groups.google.com/group/aucklug/browse_thread/thread/a82fae78e2d4ed56?hl=en-GB#>List Archive</A>.<P>

This website (hosted by <A HREF=http://www.blakjak.net>Mark Foster</A> remains in place as a basic-but-functional web presence. We also continue to encourage the use of the <A HREF=http://wiki.linux.net.nz>NZ Linux Wiki</A> as a technical resource.  No further group decisions have been made about the website specifically (as yet) but it was agreed that meeting announcements should be more widely published (Social Networking, etc).  In the end, Auckland LUG is about the local community and the meetings and mailing list are the two focal points of this. <P>

Mark is working on some adjustments to this website to let us both publicise upcoming meetings, and archive details of past meetings along with any presentation materials.  For the moment this is a work-in-progress but you can contact him (hit his website above, then then Contact link - or just send him an email if you know his address) if you have any questions or suggestions.

			<h3>Meetings & Events</h3>

				<p>AuckLUG hold monthly meetings, usually on the evening of the first Monday of every month. These meetings are usually quite informal but often feature guest speakers on a Linux or Free/Open Source related subject, a meeting of minds and some light refreshments. Details of meeting (past, and the next) can be found <A HREF=http://www.linux.net.nz/taxonomy/view/or/2 TARGET=_new>here</A>.</p>

			<h3>Contact & Membership</h3>

							<p>The Group is primarily active by way of an email <A HREF=https://groups.google.com/group/aucklug>Mailing List</A> hosted by Google Groups. Several volunteers work in the background, moderating the list and maintaining the LUG's online resources - here's how to <A HREF=/contact.html>contact them</A>.</p>

			<h3>The Fine Print</h3>
                                <p>AuckLUG is a non-incorporated group with no membership fees, and all coordination work done by volunteers. Mailing list kindly hosted on <A HREF=http://www.linux.net.nz>linux.net.nz</A>'s infrastructure, which is maintained by <A HREF=http://www.bellamy.co.nz>Nic Bellamy</A>.  AuckLUG website hosted and administered by <A HREF=http://www.blakjak.net>Mark Foster</A>.
