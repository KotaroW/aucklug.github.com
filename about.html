			<H1>About Auckland LUG</H1><P>
The Auckland Linux Users Group was formed in June 2005 as a spinoff of the long-standing <A HREF=http://www.linux.net.nz>New Zealand Linux Users Group</A>.  Historically, whilst other parts of New Zealand have had their own <A HREF=http://www.linux.net.nz/node/view/11>regional LUGs</A>, Aucklanders tended to just occupy the NZLUG Mailing list. (This in itself is a spinoff of the fact that when NZLUG was formed, it had a core membership of Aucklanders who used to regularly meet at one of their homes. Obviously, it is slightly bigger now :))
<P>
Over time it seemed that in certain corners a 'NZLUG is mainly Aucklanders' reputation was built.  This was of course not the case but - well - there was nothing in existance to prove it wrong :-)<P>

It was additionally realised by the people who regularly attend Auckland based NZLUG meetings that there would be definate advantages in a 'local' group, if only to serve for better coordination of local events and a more 'local community' feel.<P>
So in full cooperation with NZLUG, AuckLUG was formed. And here we are.<P>
<H1>What does AuckLUG do? What does it stand for?</H1><P>
<P>
<UL><LI>Raise the profile of Linux in Auckland.
<LI>Be the recognised champions of Linux in Auckland
<LI>Help make Linux and Linux related software available to Aucklanders.
<LI>Provide, in cooperation with NZLUG and other NZ regional LUGs, a resource for Linux users in Auckland and/or links to other resources.
<LI>To provide a user group with active, friendly members able to welcome and provide assistance to people entering the Linux world, as well as thos who've been playing with it for a while.
<LI>To hold regular meetings and work to provide linux related events in the Auckland area.
</UL><BR>
AuckLUG hold monthly meetings, Until April 2012 these were usually held on the evening of the First Monday of every month.  After April 2012 the routine has changed; meetings will now fall on the first weeknight of every month (making the meeting more accessible to folks for whom Mondays were a problem). Details of the next meeting will be posted to AuckLUG, to NZLUG-Announce, and to <A HREF=meetings.html>our Meetings page</A> in the days leading up to the meeting. Through AuckLUG, Aucklanders have been (and will continue to be)  active in Linux Expos and Installfests in the Auckland region, carrying on the legacy that NZLUG'rs have left in the years previously.<P>

<H1>What else is happening?</H1><P>
<UL><LI>The mailing list, which forms the core of the AuckLUG, was hosted by Linux.net.nz until December 2011, at which time a server meltdown disrupted service.  Today a <A HREF=https://groups.google.com/group/aucklug>Google Group</A> hosts Auckland LUG discussiosn.
<LI>The Website, which you're currently looking at, is a pretty basic way of getting core information out to the world. We also contribute to the <A HREF=http://wiki.linux.net.nz>New Zealand Linux Wiki</A> and encourage others to do the same; This was built on the excellent resource that <A HREF=http://www.wlug.org.nz>the Waikato Linux Users Group</A> created as their own website. The power in a Wiki is of course, in getting as many people as possible involved.

<LI>For information on our next meeting, you can join our mailing list (click the link to the group above, and then choose the 'join' link - or directly send an email to aucklug+subscrbe [at] googlegroups (dot) com), or subscribe to <A HREF=http://www.linux.net.nz/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/nzlug-announce>NZLUG-Announce</A>[currently offline], a low volume reflector carrying mainly event announcements for Linux Users Groups around NZ. Obviously joining our mailing list is best, but we recognise that some people don't necessarily want the mail volume associated with an open discussion forum.  Also note that AuckLUG has a digest mode option, providing a collation of messages every day or so.

<LI>Historical Meeting data will hopefully return to <A HREF=http://www.linux.net.nz/taxonomy/view/or/2>http://www.linux.net.nz</A>, but for coming events check out <A HREF=meetings.html>the meetings page</A>.
<LI>For the record, as of September 2010 AuckLUG has 277 mailing list subscribers.
<LI>An <B><A HREF=aup.html>Acceptable Use Policy</A></B> has been promulgated - to hopefully clarify the expected standards of behavior on the list.  These are based on standard "netiquette" but members and guests - particularly if you're new to the LUG or to the mailing list concept - are invited to take a look.
</UL><I>Site last updated 28 September 2010. Please refer to our mailing list for the latest in news and events.</I>
