                        <h3>Meetings & Events</h3>

				<p>AuckLUG hold monthly meetings, usually on the evening of the first weeknight of every month. These meetings are usually quite informal but often feature guest speakers on a Linux or Free/Open Source related subject, a meeting of minds and some light refreshments. Details of meetings can be found <A HREF=http://www.linux.net.nz/taxonomy/view/or/2 TARGET=_new>here</A> (pre April 2012, link broken) or on our <A HREF=meetings.html>meetings page</A>.</p>
			<h3>Not from Auckland?</h3>

				<p><A HREF=http://www.linux.net.nz/node/view/11>Linux.net.nz</A> maintain a list of Linux Users Groups from around NZ. There are User Groups in almost all parts of the country. If you can't find a group in your area, why not start one?  If you're aware of a group not listed, please let Nic or Mark know.</p>
