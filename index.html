<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p><strong>Auckland LUG arrangements have changed! For happenings in late 2011 and early 2012, please <a href="changes2012.html">look here</a>. :-)</strong></p>
<p>The Auckland Linux Users Group is a community of Linux enthusiasts from Auckland, New Zealand. Our mission is to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Raise the profile of Linux in Auckland.</li>
  <li>Be the recognised champions of Linux in Auckland</li>
  <li>Help make Linux and Linux related software available to Aucklanders.</li>
  <li>Provide, in cooperation with NZLUG and other NZ regional LUGs, a resource for Linux users in Auckland and/or links to other resources.</li>
  <li>To provide a user group with active, friendly members able to welcome and provide assistance to people entering the Linux world, as well as those who've been playing with it for a while.</li>
  <li>To hold regular meetings and work to provide Linux related events in the Auckland area.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Auckland LUG was 'forked' from the New Zealand Linux Users Group (NZLUG) in 2005. The NZLUG and Auckland LUG have been active in Auckland since 1998, and have been seen at many IT and Free/Open Source Events across the region over the years.</p>

<p>We look forward to continuing to support Aucklanders and show them the power, flexibility and freedom that Linux provides their computer experience. On this website you'll find information about the LUG, it's people and events, and pointers to many useful resources.</p>
