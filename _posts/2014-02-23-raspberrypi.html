    <dd>Raspberry PI's IO pins and projects</dd>

    <dt>Presenter:</dt>
    <dd>Luke Pascoe</dd>

    <dt>Start Time:</dt>
    <dd>7pm</dd>

    <dt>Summary:</dt>

		<dd>
		<p>Luke has a project that uses the Raspberry PI's IO pins to receive / send output, running on Raspian.He's going to cover his project, and then take us through the basics of getting the pins to work, with a breadboard, leds, switches, etc.</p>

		</p>If we have time, we might also watch the cool Raspberry PI hacks presentation that was on at LCA, and have a general discussion about what people are doing with their Raspberry PI systems, other than raspbmc.</p>

		<p>For those that don't know what a Raspberry PI is, it's a little cheap Linux computer, the size of a credit card.</p>
