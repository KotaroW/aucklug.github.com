		<p>Linux.conf.au was held in Perth in early January. We will cover some of the highlights, discussing
		some of the talks and things that happened at the conference.</p>

		</p>The next LCA, is going to be in Auckland, so members of the LUG are encouraged to get involved in helping the
		conference run smoothly by volunteering to help, or just attending the conference.  More details will be covered
		at the meeting.</p>

		<p>		Last, but not least, if we have time, is a section where anyone that has found a neat tool, or useful but somewhat
		unusual Linux command will be invited to briefly share it with the group. </p>
