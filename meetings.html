<B>Other Details:</B> OSS will provide Tea & Coffee.  Parking available on the street.  Feel free to turn up 10 minutes early, as we do try to kick off the actual presentation at 7.00pm.  If you turn up after 7.15pm, you'll need to call a mobile number on the door to be let in.<BR>
Usually a bunch of people meet for some food around 6.00-6.15pm before the meeting at Betsia Kebabs, 199 Symonds St.  If you're keen on meeting for dinner, please email the mailing list so others know who's coming.<BR>

<H2>Next Meeting</H2>
<B>Date:</B>Monday, 3 September 2012 [<A HREF=https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en-GB&fromgroups=#!topic/aucklug/x0mSAeztvno>Announcement</A>]<BR>
<B>Subject: </B>Time to harden up - SELinux is no longer an option<BR>
<B>Presenter: </B>Steven Ellis<BR>
<B>Start Time: </B>7pm (expected duration: 1.5 hours)<BR>
<B>Precis: </B>SELinux has been in the mainline kernel since 2003 yet still many system administrators build systems with SELinux turned off. With many of the recent Enterprise Linux releases we are now at a point where fully enabled SELinux should be the norm.<BR>

The purpose of this session is to demystify SELinux and show some of the tools now available to tweak and tune without compromising the security features SELinux offers.<BR>

Steven has been involved in Open Source for over 20 years, and a Linux user for over 15 years. Since moving to New Zealand he has provided technical direction and operational guidance for a number of New Zealand companies on the use of Open Source and Linux. His experience has included over 3 years running the the Linux operations team at IBM NZ, and the development of myPVR a MythTV based PVR solution designed for the New Zealand Market. He now works for Red Hat as a Solution Architect for NZ focusing on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and their Virtualisation products. <BR>
